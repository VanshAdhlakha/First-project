I was already lerning python, bit by bit since 3 years. But finally after completing my school, I got time to focus on what I like. 
So I did revise all the basis I had learnt in just 2 hours I was able to do all this and also made this project along with 2 more similiar projects.
If you simply run it will open the notepad using the subprocess, which makes it fast and do multiple things at a  time, and it will type your desired message, you can repeat it as many times as you want.
